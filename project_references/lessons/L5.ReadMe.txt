In this lesson we will discuss the Bitcoin simulation you are doing for your homework.
The simulation you are running week is a version of of Arthur Gervais bitcoin simulator which is published on the web.
The outputs of this simulation are very important for Bitcoin investors.
The results prove conclusively that:
Bitcoin's transaction per second speed cannot be changed, 
not by increasing the block size,
not by decreasing the time between blocks (that is, decreasing the difficulty level)
If you do that, Bitcoin's security is compromised.
So all those investors who are waiting for Bitcoin to become more efficient,
can wait forever.
It won't.
Not unless Bitcoin decides to change its consensus algorithm.
Substitute proof of work by some other consensus.

One very interesting result of the Bitcoin simulation by Arthur Gervais is that
that the Bitcoin network's security will become unstable once the minting of bitcoin stops (by 2040).
The reason is that at that point the miner's only source of revenue will be the fees, and
we cannot know if those fees will be enough to produce enough profit for the miners to remain honest.
So after 2040 the miners will be more tempted than ever to become dishonest.
How can they become dishonest?
By engaging in selfish mining, which 
is a topic that we covered last class, in slides 4 to 6 of 2.Bitcoin_Simulator_1.pptx.
This is a pressing subject and yet
no overall solution has yet been proposed at the level of the bitcoin network consensus algorithm (proof of work) that 
deals effectively with selfish mining.
Yet there are some recent approaches 
propose that the solution to the selfish mining problem is best implemented 
at the mining pool level, and
not at the level of the bitcoin network consensus algorithm.
In particular, recent approaches suggest that the solution lies in
finding the correct equation that calculates the mining reward for miners that work in a mining pool.
For more info see SelfishMiningSolutionForMiningPools.pdf in Miscellaneous.


This is one reason why we believe that Bitcoin's consensus algorithm will probably be modified in the future.
But what modifications are there that Bitcoin could implement.
In this class we will cover this particular subject.

So in this lesson we will discuss consensus algorithms in general.
We will begin by providing a:
History of Consensus Algorithms
And we will cover:
the Fischer-Lynch-Patterson Trilemma which establishes that
a consensus algorithm is faced with a tradeoff between liveness and safety, it cannot have 100% of both.
Liveness means that non-faulty processors eventually decide upon some output, and
safety means that non-faulty processors agree on the correct output.
This is a scholarly way of stating a private joke that runs in our family:
when we were teaching the multiplication tables to our son,
we would test him asking "what is 7 times 9" and
he would answer: what do you want: velocity or precision?
This is the same question that the Fischer-Lynch-Patterson Trilemma forces upon a consensus algorithm
It has to choose.

So there are many different consensus algorithms that depend upon this choice.
The first one we will discuss is the earliest and most important:
The Lamport, Shostak and Pease Byzantine Fault Tolerant Algorithm (BFT)
BFT is important for you to understand because BFT form the basis
of a whole family of algorithms that underlie Digital Ledger Technologies (DLTs).
BFT quickly evolved into the well known
Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant Algorithms (PBFT)
PBFT is a faster BFT that forms the basis of the Hyperledger Project DLTs, which 
is an important open-source DLT library.

After discussing PBFT we discuss another consensus family called:
Proof of Stake Consensus
Proof of Stake allows a miner to compete with other miners on the basis of money at "stake," 
instead of on the basis of hashing power.

Then we discuss how you can hybridize these various consensus algorithms
Because you can hybridize the consensus algorithms, there are quite a few of them
So it is important to have a way of evaluating them
Therefore, in the latter part of the presentation we discuss an:
Evaluation Table of Consensus Protocols
We also discuss:
The Factors Hampering the Application of Blockchain Technology
