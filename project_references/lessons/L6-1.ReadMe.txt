In this lesson we will cover the whole of Ethereum and its applications.
We will publish 2 lessons at once: lesson 6 and lesson 7
because
we want you to have as much material as possible and 
as much time as possible for your projects.
The project due date is to be published.
However if you have a graduation deadline, you must turn in your project one week before your grade-turn-in deadline.

So for lesson 6 we cover two topics:
1. The Etherum blockchain: its structure and how it differs from the Bitcoin blockchain.
2. How to program an Ethereum client, using:
a. Solidity and Javascript programming languages
b. One Javascript library: Web3.

As regards the second topic, Ethereum client programming,
we provide all the materials for this starting from zero.
This will be a complete minicourse on Ethereum client programming.
You will not get a similar minicourse anywhere else:
most free tutorials in the internet, and 
even some paid tutorials 
are outdated due to changes.

Not all the material in the minicourse is equally important.
The most important part is:

2.HelloWorld
3.HelloWorldUI
4.Web4Basics
5.METACOIN
6.Example - Dapp_mod
7.Elections tutorial_WEB3UPDATED

One option for your final project is to program a simple Ethereum client.
Another option is to write a tutorial on Ethereum client programming
for your own benefit, if you want to review these materials in the future.

For lesson 7 we cover:
the applications of Ethereum and other blockchains to many business areas,
including the interaction of blockchain with the Internet Of Things (IoT),
which, as engineers,
you are probably aware of.
One option for your final project is to write a research paper on 
an application of the Ethereum blockchain to a business case,
or, on a specialized blockchain buit to solve a business case.

The client programming minicourse is very heavy.
The Ethereum applications are heavy too.
The reason is: there are lots of Demos that you can run and download.
And videos of the Demos being run, to guide you in how to run them.
As well as other videos of blockchain applications and discussions.
And there is, of course, quite a bit of code in the form of self-contained Demo projects.
Some of the Demos projects contain a Node Modules directory that is quite heavy.

We have put all the materials for sessions 6 and 7 in a Google drive for you to download.
The download should be quicker than from Quercus but still
prepare yourself to wait a long while for the download to complete.

You will also find a guidance for the final projects.
This guidance is L6.ProjectGuide.txt
You will see that you can do one of three types of projects.
The guidance explains the three projects in detail.
