This being the last class on Bitcoin (the next 3 classes are on cryptography) we wanted to give an idea 
of how one can trade a currency 
while keeping volatility reasonably low.
The traditional way of trading a currency is to use a pairs trading strategy where
one trades a spread between currencies that one knows before hand 
are currencies that track one another.
However, although such a strategy can be applied to crypto-currencies 
it is very hard to keep volatility reasonably low because
crypto-currencies are extremely volatile.
Nonetheless, we are going to show you 
how pairs trading is done in the hope that
such a strategy could be applied in the future, when
crypto-currencies volatility has decreased.

Because trading and investing are risky activities,
we have devoted this class to the idea of arbitrage and
discussed whether or not arbitrage exists in the world of crypto-currencies.
Hopefully you will come away better informed about this subject
and will not fall for a number of scams in the internet
that convince users that arbitrages exist where they do not.
