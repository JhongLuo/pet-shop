This class will be about crypto currency valuation
in particular Bitcoin valuation
We saw in the first lesson that Bitcoin can be valued in a number of ways.
Bitcoin can be viewed as:
Commodity (mining costs)
Currency (demand vs supply equation)
Network (Metcalfe’s law of utility)
Platform/Technology (Moore’s law)

In this class we will dive into a model of Bitcoin's value as
described by Metcalfe's law, 
a law that measures the utility of a network.
Originally it was applied to a telephone network, but 
it can be applied to any network whose utility grows exponentially 
with the number of users.

This Metcalfe model is based on Timothy Peterson's paper, which
you can find in the miscellaneous folder.
We implemented Peterson's model using an Excel spreadsheet.
The purpose of the Excel spreadsheet is to explain how the model works,
but the real implementation is a Python program: gls.py, which
you can also find in the miscellanous folder.
The reason why we went through the trouble of displaying this model at length in Excel is that
it is not a regular regression model, but instead 
it is a special kind of regression called 
"generalized differences" or "generalized least squares" or GLS.
GLS exists because often when 
one tries to use a regression to predict a time series 
consisting of prices of a financial instrument
the residuals of the regression will turn out to be auto-correlated.
This means the regression will not be biased but 
the predictions of the regression will range 
over an interval that will be very wide,
wider than it needs to be, and
if one attempts to use the regression results 
to calculate a confidence interval for the predictions
this calculation will result in a confidence interval that is incorrect: 
the confidence interval will be deceptively small.
GLS attempts to correct a regular regression for the auto-correlation of the residuals.
So we have tried to give you an idea of how a GLS model works.
We have also included in miscellaneous a chapter of our favorite statistics textbook 
(Wonnacott's) on how GLS works.


We have also included a short presentation on
how to value a crypto currency as though it were an investment project.
This second presentation is not too detailed,
but it gives a general idea of how such valuations are carried out.
