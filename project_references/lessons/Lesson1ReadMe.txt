This is the first session of the course APS 1050H F LEC9101 Blockchain Technologies and Cryptocurrencies

This course will cover blockchain technologies from 4 different points of view,
so the course has 4 parts:

The first part is:
how the blockchain works (first 5 classes) 
will cover blockchain technologies and will define a great many terms 
that are needed to read and understand blockchain project white papers.
As you probably know, in the blockchain world
a white paper is the main document that explains a blockhain project to the public.
These white papers are notoriously hard to understand because of the specialized vocabulary they use.
After taking this course, you will be able to read these white papers,
for purposes of job seeking, investing, etc.

The second part is:
How to program an Ethereum client.
This part is actually a minicourse with a number of presentations 
from Hello World on...
written for beginners, with more than a hundred slides and many demos.
There is a lot of material in this minicourse but only some of it is obligatory to read.
We like to include optional demos and presentations for the sake of completeness and
in case you need reference material after the course is over.

The third part is:
How the blockchain's cryptography works.
This consists of 3 lessons where 
we give an accesible but still well based understanding of the basic concepts.
Nonetheless, most the homework for this part of the course is optional,
so the math content should be interesting, not a source of worry.

The fourth part is
Topics in how blockchain impacts finance/economy, 
how to trade bitcoin etc. (2 lessons)
There is no homework for this part of the course either.

So you will notice that this course frontloads most of the homework the homework in the first 6 weeks,
and there is almost no obligatory homework after the middle of the course,
with one possible exception: a small homework or quiz about the cryptography part.
The reason is that we want you to concentrate on your projects, which
are worth the most for your grade.

So moving on to the delivery and grading structure of the course,
it is located in 
the document on Quercus entitled "ADMINISTRATIVE_Blockchain.docx"

As per the "ADMINISTRATIVE_Blockchain.docx,"
the delivery will be as follows:
Every class will have uploaded materials that 
are meant to be self contained, and
every class will be accompanied by a zoom session.
The purpose of the zoom session is not to provide new material, or
to present the uploaded class material in detail.
The purpose of the zoom session is:
to pinpoint the highlights of the class material, and
offer some extra guidance, especially administrative.
We prefer to answer technical questions on Piazza, where
our answers can be as detailed as needed and
persist for other students to see.
We will write up a summary of the session and upload it to Quercus
as a "ReadMe.txt" document.

The course uploaded materials will always have 4 zip folders:
1. a Powerpoint presentations zip folder containing the presentations.
2. a guides to the Powerpoints zip folder containing speeches that serve as guides for the presentations.
3. a voiceovers zip folder containing the voiceovers of the speeches in the guides folder.
4. a miscellaneous zip folder containing ancillary materials, like readings, spreadsheets and programs.

Many students have told us in our surveys that voiceovers are helpful because 
they allow students to have just one document displayed on their desktop at a time,
instead of having two documents side by side.
But:
since the voiceovers were created by a web service and
the input for the voiceovers were the guides,
this means that the guides do not (cannot) contain formatted equations, instead
the formatted equations appear on the slides.
In other words, the guides contain English-like equations that 
are specifically formatted to be read in English by the web service.

As per this "ADMINISTRATIVE_Blockchain.docx,"
The grading of the course is as follows:
Individual homework tasks are worth 40% of the grade.
The final team project is worth 60% of the grade.

Teams are expected to be of at most 4 people.
We do not assign teams, but 
we do provide tools for students to build their own teams,
as explained in the "ADMINISTRATIVE_Blockchain.docx.

As regards the homework that is worth 40% of the grade,
the homework relates to the first 5 sessions of the course and
is expected to be individual work, not team work.
The homework tasks consist of 
setting up some blockchain related programs that we will give you,
running, recording the results and interpreting them.
This homework will not be too difficult but
you will have to spend some time to complete it because
the setup of some of the programs can be long, and
running some of the programs can take 3 or 4 hours.
Running programs and interpreting the results may seem an unusual kind of homework to you, but
we believe that the only way to truly understand the blockchain
is to actually do things with it, not just read about it.
So among other things,
you will learn how to initiate transactions in a a test nest blockchain, and
how to keep track of them.
A test net blockchain is a blockchain that developers use.
It works exactly like the real blockchain but does not require you to spend real money.

As regards the final project that is worth 60% of the grade,
the final project can be a team or an individual project.
You can find a summary description of the final project in:
PersonalAndTeamProjects.txt, on Quercus.
Detailed instructions will be provided in session 6.

The final project due date is:
One week after the last day of classes

There are three options we envision regarding the final project:

Option 1:
Research project = Personal project = 60% of grade

Option 2:
Programming project = Personal or team project = 60% of grade

Option 3:
Tutorial project: = Personal project = 60% of the grade


RESEARCH PROJECT==================================================================================================

RESEARCH PROJECT DELIVERABLE

A reseach paper 
modelled on a Harvard case (to be distributed) and 
covering a particular blockchain project.
The length of the paper should be at least 15 pages,
and 600 words per page.
This is an individual project, not a team project.

To be able to write this research project
you need to understand the material in the first 5 sessions of the course, thanks to which
will enable you to understand the terminology used in the blockchain white papers.
So, since there is no more homework after the first half of the course approximately,
you can start your own research for the final research project early on,
if that is what you decide to do.

PROGRAMMING PROJECT===============================================================================================

PROGRAMMING PROJECT DELIVERABLE

You will be programming and turning in a DApp, that is 
an Ethereum client program, but 

We do NOT expect you to progam a DApp from scratch.
We will provide you with a seed DApp, and
you will enlarge the DApp with five major modifications to make the DApp more useful.

For this purpuse we will provide the following:
We will give you a list of possible major modifications.
We will also give you (and of course, explain) a number of simple DApps.
Each of these simple DApps contains one or two useful features that
you can use to enlarge your final project DApp.
So basically for the final project you need to understand the simple DApps well enough so as
to be able to transfer features (by transferring and modifying code) 
from the simple DApps
to the seed DApp that you need to enlarge.
 
To be able to program this final project DApp
you will study the non-optional parts of the Ethereum minicourse.

In the minicourse you will understand 
why blockchain programmers are so well paid.
To program a blockchain client you need to understand:
how to program a web based front end using JQuery
how to program an Ethereum smart contract and
how to use asynchronous javascript 
to connect the two.
So blockchain programming involves learning at least 3 libraries:
JQuery, Web3 and Solidity.

There are many buggy and outdated Ethereum blockchain programming videos on the web,
but our minicourse is up to date, all the apps run etc.
The minicourse materials are geared towards beginners but
if you are a developer already 
we will gladly make available more advanced materials if you request them.

In any case, especially if you are already an experienced developper 
who wants to learn blockchain programming,
there is one requirement that we cannot change:
You need to use the Truffle framework and Ganache combo, and also
for the front end, you need to use preferably JQuery 
(React is ok, but too advanced for beginners in the course).
Can't change this requirement.
Anyway, the Truffle framework and Ganache are wonderful tools, that 
are very helpful beginners learning blockchain programming.

As an alternative to programming a DAPP
You can instead write a tutorial DApp for your own reference in the future.
In that case you must include a 25 page (600 word per page) tutorial script. 

We will provide additional details about these projects in session 6.
